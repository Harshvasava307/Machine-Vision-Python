# 🧠 Machine-Vision-Python

This repository showcases a set of **Machine Vision** demo projects built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.  
Each module demonstrates real-time computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control various system functions.

---

## 📘 Catalogue

1. **pointer.py** — Control your mouse cursor virtually using hand gestures.  
2. **virtual_painter.py** — Draw freely on a NumPy canvas with your hand acting as a brush.  
3. **volume_control.py** — Adjust your system’s volume using simple hand movements.  
4. **Other helper modules** — Contain smaller utilities and submodules supporting the above main programs.

## ⚙️ Requirements

**Python:** 3.8.0 or newer  
🔗 [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe

🚀 Getting Started

After installing dependencies, you can run any script using the command line:

python filename.py


Example:

python pointer.py

💡 Description

These projects demonstrate the power of Machine Vision by combining OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand movements and interpret them as commands.
You can use this repository as a base to explore interactive gesture-controlled systems, virtual tools, and computer vision applications.
